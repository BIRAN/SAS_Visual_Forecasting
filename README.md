Research wiki
=============

I used to store paper-to-read/finished in OneTab. Clearly, using Github is much better approach for sharing the information. 
So I use github's wiki for this purpose and make it as a start.

My research subject at SAS is time series forecasting.  

## Statistical methods

1. ARIMA/ Seasonal ARIMA

2. VAR/ VARMAX

## Machine learning

1. Neural Network

2. etc

## Deep learning

1. LSTM

2. [Dilated CNN/ TCN](https://github.com/BIRAN/SAS_Visual_Forecasting/wiki/dilated-CNN)
