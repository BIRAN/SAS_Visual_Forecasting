Research related publications and demos


Research wiki
=============

I used to store paper-to-read/finished in OneTab. Clearly, using Github is much better approach for sharing the information. 
So I use github's wiki for this purpose and make it as a start.

My research subject at SAS is time series forecasting.  

## Statistical methods

1. [ARIMA/ Seasonal ARIMA](https://github.com/BIRAN/SAS_Visual_Forecasting/blob/master/statistical_method/SARIMA_demo.ipynb)

2. [ESM](https://github.com/BIRAN/SAS_Visual_Forecasting/blob/master/statistical_method/ESM_demo.ipynb)

3. VAR/VARMAX

## Machine learning

1. Neural Network

2. etc

## Deep learning

1. LSTM

2. [Dilated CNN/ TCN](https://github.com/BIRAN/SAS_Visual_Forecasting/wiki/dilated-CNN)


I believe that in the french quote "Ce qui se conçoit bien s'énonce clairement - Et les mots pour le dire arrivent aisément" (*L'Art poétique* by Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux (1674)), which roughly translates to "what you clearly understand is easy to explain - and words come easy". This quote is very important to me, because I realized that it is so true.

My goal is indeed to clearly understand all these annotated papers, therefore, I hope that my notes can be easily understood by anyone who has an interest in these papers.

Enough said ! Head to the [wiki](https://github.com/BIRAN/SAS_Visual_Forecasting/wiki).
